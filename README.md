# My React Journey

This will be a brief documentation for most of my React JS Projects.

- It should help my track my learning process
- It will display my improvement over times
- It is an opportunity to get feedback

## Projects

### Project #1

My first React application

It is a simple expense tracker where the user can add new expenses and filter the expenses by the year.

#### What I learned

- I learned and practiced the React basics through this project (components structure, JSX, React hooks - useState)
- I also learned lifting data and states up the structure tree, which I still believe is complex and cumbersome steps
- **Bonus** I added the ability to remove expenses and it was great to search and implement new features on my own from the first project
