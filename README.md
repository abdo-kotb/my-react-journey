# My React Journey

This will be a brief documentation for most of my React JS Projects.

- It should help my track my learning process
- It will display my improvement over times
- It is an opportunity to get feedback

## Projects

### Project #1

My first React application

It is a simple expense tracker where the user can add new expenses and filter the expenses by the year.

| Code on Github                                                  | Demo                                                    |

| [Expenses Tracker](https://github.com/abdo-kotb/my-react-journey/tree/main/expenses-tracker) | [Live demo](https://react-expensestracker.netlify.app/) |

#### What I learned

- I learned and practiced the React basics through this project (components structure, JSX, React hooks - useState)
- I also learned lifting data and states up the structure tree, which I still believe is complex and cumbersome steps
- **Bonus** I added the ability to remove expenses and it was great to search and implement new features on my own from the first project

### Project #2

Add Users Form

It is a simple form application where users can add their names and ages, with a validation and different error modals.

| Code on Github                                                  | Demo                                                    |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Add Users](https://github.com/abdo-kotb/my-react-journey/tree/main/add-users) | [Live demo](https://addusers-react.netlify.app) |

#### What I learned

- Unlike the first project I built this one compeletly on my own with more practice on the basices I learned from the first project
- I practiced styling the components using css modules and learned about Styled Components
- I learned the React fragments and portals, and the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components, and continued learning the hooks [useRef]

### Project #3

Food Order App

This is a food order application covers all the core concepts in React where users can add meals to the cart and change the amount and see the prices reflecting.

| Code on Github                                                  | Demo                                                    |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Food Order App](https://github.com/abdo-kotb/food-order-app) | [Live demo](https://mealsreact.netlify.app/) |

#### What I learned

This was the most complex application yet.
It covered all the React concepts I have studied so far from components and styling to hooks, fragments, and portals.
With a slightly bigger project like this one, I am starting to sense why to use React.

All hooks covered in this project: (useState, useContext, useEffect, useReducer, useRef)
Other tools: (portals, fragments, context, forwardRef, CSS Modules)

### Project #3 V2

I continued to practice more react advanced concepts on the Food Order App project

| Code on Github                                                  | Demo                                                    |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Food Order App](https://github.com/abdo-kotb/food-order-app) | [Live demo](https://mealsreact.netlify.app/) |

#### What I learned

- This might be my first interaction with the backend web world, though I only used the Firebase backend platform and did not code or use any backend languages yet.
- There was no local data. I fetched the meals data from the server, and I also sent the users data from the cart form to the server.
- The only difference between React and Vanilla JS with AJAX is side effects, but it was great to practice it again and learn the new stuff.
- Creating form validation with Vanilla JS so far was a bit easier than React, but the overall ordering process is of course much faster with React.
