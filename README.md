# My React Journey

This will be a brief documentation for most of my React JS Projects.

- It should help my track my learning process
- It will display my improvement over times
- It is an opportunity to get feedback

## Projects

### Project #1

My first React application

It is a simple expense tracker where the user can add new expenses and filter the expenses by the year.

| Code on Github                                                  | Demo                                                    |

#### What I learned

- I learned and practiced the React basics through this project (components structure, JSX, React hooks - useState)
- I also learned lifting data and states up the structure tree, which I still believe is complex and cumbersome steps
- **Bonus** I added the ability to remove expenses and it was great to search and implement new features on my own from the first project

### Project #2

Add Users Form

It is a simple form application where users can add their names and ages, with a validation and different error modals.

| Code on Github                                                  | Demo                                                    |

| [Expenses Tracker](https://github.com/abdo-kotb/my-react-journey/tree/main/add-users) | [Live demo](https://addusers-react.netlify.app) |

#### What I learned

- Unlike the first project I built this one compeletly on my own with more practice on the basices I learned from the first project
- I practiced styling the components using css modules and learned about Styled Components
- I learned the React fragments and portals, and the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components, and continued learning the hooks [useRef]
